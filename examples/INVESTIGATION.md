# Portfolio Design Investigation

## Purpose

Before building your own portfolio, take time to study these example portfolios. Each one meets the same technical requirements but makes very different design choices. By analyzing these differences, you'll start developing your own design taste and vision for your portfolio.

**Goal:** Identify what you like, what you don't like, and why. There are no right answers—only your preferences.

## Investigation Areas

### 1. Color & Theme

All portfolios use CSS variables to define their color palette. Compare how each one approaches color.

**Questions to consider:**
- Which portfolios use a **dark background** vs. **light background**? Which do you prefer and why?
- How many **accent colors** does each portfolio use? (Some use one, others use several)
- Which portfolios use **gradients**? Which use **solid colors**?
- How does the color choice affect the **mood** or **personality** of the site?

**Your notes:**
> _Write what you observe and what appeals to you..._

### 2. Typography & Font Pairing

Each portfolio uses custom fonts to create a distinct personality.

| Example | Display Font       | Body Font  | Vibe                       |
| ------- | ------------------ | ---------- | -------------------------- |
| 0       | Quicksand          | Quicksand  | Clean, friendly, rounded   |
| 1       | Lora               | Lora       | Elegant, refined, literary |
| 2       | Syne               | Outfit     | Modern, bold, geometric    |
| 3       | Archivo Black      | Space Mono | Bold, edgy, technical      |
| 4       | Orbitron           | Rajdhani   | Futuristic, sci-fi         |
| 5       | Cormorant Garamond | DM Sans    | Elegant, editorial         |

**Questions to consider:**
- Which portfolios use **serif fonts** for headings? Which use **sans-serif**?
- How does the font choice contribute to the overall **personality**?
- Notice the **letter-spacing** (tracking)—which feel more open/airy? Which feel tighter?
- Which typography style feels most like "you"?

**Your notes:**
> _Write what you observe and what appeals to you..._

---

### 3. Navigation Design

All portfolios have a sticky navigation bar with the same four links, but they look very different.

**Questions to consider:**
- How does each portfolio style its **logo**? (Initials, full name, icon, etc.)
- What happens when you **hover** over nav links? (Underlines, background changes, color shifts)
- How are the nav links **formatted**? (ALL CAPS vs. lowercase, brackets, etc.)
- Which navigation feels most intuitive to you?

**Your notes:**
> _Write what you observe and what appeals to you..._

---

### 4. Hero Section Layout

The hero (home) section is the first thing visitors see. Each portfolio approaches this differently.

**Questions to consider:**
- Which heroes are **centered**? Which are **left-aligned**?
- How is the **name** displayed? (All one line, split across lines, outlined text, glowing)
- What **call-to-action buttons** are used? How are they styled?
- Which hero section makes the strongest first impression on you?

**Your notes:**
> _Write what you observe and what appeals to you..._

---

### 5. Project Cards

All portfolios display projects with similar information (title, description, tech tags, links) but arrange them differently.

**Questions to consider:**
- How many **columns** does each grid use on desktop? On mobile?
- Are the cards **horizontal** (image beside text) or **vertical** (image above text)?
- How are the **project images/placeholders** styled?
- What **hover effects** do the cards have? (Lift, glow, background change, border change)
- Which project display would best showcase YOUR work?

**Your notes:**
> _Write what you observe and what appeals to you..._

---

### 6. Whitespace & Density

Whitespace (empty space) dramatically affects how a design feels.

**Questions to consider:**
- Which portfolios feel **spacious and airy**? Which feel more **dense and compact**?
- Look at the **padding** inside sections—which have more breathing room?
- How does whitespace affect **readability**?
- Do you prefer minimal designs with lots of whitespace, or do you like more content-rich layouts?

**Your notes:**
> _Write what you observe and what appeals to you..._

---

### 7. Borders, Shadows & Visual Accents

Small details like borders and shadows contribute significantly to a design's personality.

**Questions to consider:**
- Which portfolios use **thick, visible borders**? Which have **subtle or no borders**?
- Compare the **shadow styles**: offset/brutalist, soft/diffused, glowing, or none?
- What **corner radius** do you see? (Sharp corners, slightly rounded, very rounded)
- Are there any **decorative elements**? (Floating shapes, lines, icons)

**Your notes:**
> _Write what you observe and what appeals to you..._

---

### 8. Hover Effects & Micro-interactions

Hover effects give users feedback and add personality. 

**Questions to consider:**
- What happens when you hover over **buttons**? (Color change, lift, glow, grow)
- What happens when you hover over **project cards**? (Shadow, scale, border change)
- What happens when you hover over **links**? (Underline appears, color change)
- Which hover effects feel **satisfying**? Which feel **too subtle** or **too dramatic**?

**Your notes:**
> _Write what you observe and what appeals to you..._

---

### 9. Contact Form Styling

All portfolios have a contact form with name, email, and message fields.

**Questions to consider:**
- How are **labels** positioned? (Above input, floating, etc.)
- What do the **input fields** look like? (Background color, border style, shape)
- What happens when you **focus** on an input? (Border color, shadow, glow)
- How is the **submit button** styled compared to other buttons on the page?

**Your notes:**
> _Write what you observe and what appeals to you..._

---

### 10. Overall Personality & Mood

Step back and consider the holistic impression of each portfolio.

**Questions to consider:**
- If each portfolio were a **person**, how would you describe their personality?
- Which portfolio feels most **professional**? Most **creative**? Most **approachable**?
- Which portfolio would be best for a job at a **corporate company**? A **startup**? A **creative agency**?
- Which portfolio feels most authentically like **you** and your personality?

**Your notes:**
> _Write what you observe and what appeals to you..._

### Hover Effects
> What kind of hover effects do you want? (Subtle or dramatic? Color changes? Lifts? Glows?)

### Overall Vibe
> In 3-5 words, describe the feeling you want your portfolio to give visitors:

## Bonus: CSS Variables to Customize

When you build your portfolio, you'll define CSS variables like these. Start thinking about your choices:

```css
:root {
  /* What colors will you use? */
  --color-bg: _______;
  --color-text: _______;
  --color-accent: _______;
  
  /* What fonts will you pair? */
  --font-display: _______;
  --font-body: _______;
  
  /* What border radius feels right? */
  --radius: _______; /* 0px? 8px? 16px? 9999px? */
  
  /* How much spacing do you want? */
  --space-section: _______; /* How much padding between sections? */
}
```

2. Identify 2-3 specific elements you want to incorporate
3. Sketch a rough layout for your portfolio (paper is fine!)
4. Start building!

Remember: Your portfolio is a reflection of YOU. Use these examples as inspiration, but make it your own!
